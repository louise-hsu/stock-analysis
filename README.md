# Stock-analysis
Purpose: To help Steve analyze his stock data using VBA. I learned the basic VBA syntax, if statements, for loops, nested for loops, defining, types, counters, formatting, activating sheets,  subs, assigning macros to buttosns, and more. 

# Challenge
Please view the **green_stocks_Challege 2** to see the final and code for the Module 2 challenge assignment. The Sub is called Challenge, and the sheet is Module 2. I refactored the All Stock Anaylsis code  to loop through all through all the data rows from either the 2017 or 2018 once and storing the data into arrays. 

**ANALYSIS**: Looking at the 2017 data, we can see that all stocks, except TERP, received a positive return. While the 2018 data showed almost all negative returns other than ENPH and RUN. The return of the same stocks between 2017 and 2018 seem to have no correlation. Since the the return of stocks took a 160 degree turn for almost all stocks, I would infer that the stocks market in 2017 was doing a lot better and it was a better year to make an investment in these particular stocks. Maybe 2018 was a bad year to invest in these partiular stocks or maybe the stock market overall declined in 2018.
